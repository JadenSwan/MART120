The GUI is how the average person interacts with the operating system on their computer, with very easy-to-understand pictures and images,
like instalation wizards and scroll bars. It does consume more memory however, since the computer has to remember all of these items 
(pictures, scrollbars, etc.)The CLI is the more difficult way to interact with the OS, but its a direct link to the OS. This is done by the
user putting in lines of code for the OS to respond to. The CLI is the way that programmers interact with the OS, since it offers a direct 
link to the OS and gives more power and access to the programmer. It also consumes way less memory, since the computer doesnt have to store 
the files for the scrollbars, wizards, and other things that it does on the GUI. For imput, the GUI lets you enter the imputs anywhere on screen, 
while the CLI requires you to input it into the command screen.
