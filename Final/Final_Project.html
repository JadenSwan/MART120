            <p><h1>Summary of my Favorite Legion</h1></p>
        <p>The Thousand Sons are the once 15th Legion of the Imperium of Mankind. Their story starts with their Primarch, or the head of the legion, Magnus the Red. When all of the Emperor of Mankind's sons were scattered throughout the galaxy, Magnus landed on the world called Prospero. Prospero was a world filled with <a href=https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Psyker>psykers</a> and intellects. Magnus was raised from these people, and very quickly (with his superhuman gifts towards magic and intelligence) surpassed even the best psyker on the planet. As he got older, he unified the planet together, and brought the planet to a place of peace and prosperity.
            He even constructed a giant pyramid in the planet's capital city of Tizca. But he is not perfect. Despite his teachers warnings, he craved the knowledge of the Warp, or the place where all of the psychic energy is sourced from. It is also where the daemons and evil gods, also known as the Chaos Gods of the galaxy are, leading it to be very dangerous waters to swim in. But Magnus brushed away these warnings, and continued to peer into the Immaterium.

        <p>During the <a href=https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Crusade>Great Crusade</a>, the Emperor of Mankind found Magnus. He was the 15th son to be found (hence the 15th Legion), and Magnus immediately recognized him as his father, and joined the Imperium of Man. Some people theorize that Magnus could speak to the Emperor psychically before he was even born! He was given his <a href=https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Marines >Space Marine</a> legion, and he studied the Immaterium with his father. He also joined in his fathers conquest of the galaxy for the Imperium (think like The Holy Crusades. Not good). Just a reminder: the Imperium of Mankind are not the good guys in this setting. No one is. 
        </p>
        <p>Later on, to Magnus' surprise, psychic powers were severely limited by the Emperor, despite it being his and his legion strength. Despite this ban, he still continued to study the Warp, making him butt heads with his brother and Primarch of the Space Wolves Legion Leman Russ, who always despised psychic powers. 
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of the <a href=https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Horus_Heresy>Horus Heresy</a>, Magnus saw a vision, including where he realizes that his brother and Warmaster Horus had betrayed the Imperium and joined the side of the Chaos Gods. He needed to get this news to his father as soon as possible, so he psychically sent himself to the Palace of Terra. When he arrived, he could not get into his fathers mind. Unbenounced to Magnus and all of his brothers, their father was working on a secret project to try and figure out the Eldar Webway so that the Imperium could use it to travel through space. Since he was busy doing this, he had put up a psychic barrier (I know, hypocrisy) to protect the Palace of Terra from daemons. Magnus tried his best to break through, but couldn't figure a way through. Then, a warp creature offered him the knowledge to get through. Without a second thought, he accepted and breached the Palace. This is where he messed up. As soon as he did this, thousands upon thousands of daemons swarmed the Palace and killed many of the Adeptus Mechanicus who were helping out the Emperor on his secret project. With this sudden breach, the Emperor of Mankind assumed that Magnus was the son that had betrayed him, and commanded Horus to retrieve Magnus, as he stayed on Terra to psychically fight off the Chaos invasion so as to not completely destroy the Palace.
        </p>
        <p>Unknown to the Emperor (supposedly*), Horus was going to do some crazy stuff. Since Horus wasn't known to his brothers as the traitor, he told Leman Russ to go kill Magnus since he was “the traitor”. So, Russ and his legion went to the planet of Prospero to go kill the Thousand Sons and Magnus. As a sort of “payment” for his failure, Magnus did not join the battle for a large portion of it and did not warn his legion of the incoming battle, as he realized that Tzeentch, the Chaos god of trickery and magic, was the one who gave him the info to break into the Palace. This was part of Tzeentch's plan to wipe out two Space Marine legions. Eventually, he joined the battle. He and his brother fought valiantly against one another. Leman Russ eventually gets a hold of him and slams Magnus' back over his knee. In this desperate moment, Tzeentch offers a chance for him to save his legion if he pledged his soul to the chaos god. Magnus agrees, and he and his whole legion were immediately transported into the Immaterium.
        </p>
        <p>In the Immaterium, all of the living members of the legion were on route to becoming mindless daemons from Tzeentch's “gifts”. Azhek Arhiman, who was Magnus' closest advisor since the start of the Legion, wanted to find a solution to this. He and many other sorcerers joined together to find a spell that would undo this curse. They soon did, but it came at a high price. As soon as the spell was cast, the curse was gone, but it immediately killed every non-psychic warrior and entombed their ashes into their power armor, making a majority of the legion mindless automatons. For the few who did survive, the mutations were gone, but Magnus immediately banned all of them from the Planet of the Sorcerers (their new home in the Warp) for their crime, and forever tasked them to find the true meaning of Chaos.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays, Arhiman and his comrades search the universe for an answer to undo the now called “Rubric of Ahriman”. Magnus The Red was changed into a Daemon Prince for Tzeentch, and lives up on the highest tower on the Planet of Sorcerers, which is a cheap mockery of Prospero. He waits and plots his revenge against the Imperium of Man and the Emperor of Mankind who had stabbed him in the back. The largest tragedy of all is that Magnus doesn't know that the Emperor never tried to kill him, but rather Horus.

        <p>*I say supposedly since the Emperor of Mankind is basically a god, so how the hell would he have *not* known that Horus would go traitor?? But that's a whole 'nother can of worms to open for another day.
